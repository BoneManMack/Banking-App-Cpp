This project was built to calculate interest over time and display yearly interest earnings along with a balance total.

The program is split into modules that makes the code easy to read and understand. Comments are provided throughout the code to aid in understanding the code.

Missing components are input validations. Adding those will enhance the code and prevent the program from crashing.

The interest calculator was the hardest part to write. I had to keep track of the month and add one to the calculation from my for loop in order for the data to get moved to the vector properly. I've been using the C++ documentation and YouTube to help me overcome my issues when writing code.

Passing information around throughout my code and developing my code in modules are the two thiings I think will be very useful in my career in the future.

I used modular design, comments, and names that align with the purpose of the functions, classes, and variables to make my code easily readable, maintainable, and adaptable.
